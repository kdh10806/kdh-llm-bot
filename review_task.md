There seems to be a confusion between two different novels and their settings—Markus Zusak’s 'The Book Thief,' which is set in WWII Germany, depicting Liesel Meminger’s struggle with gender roles against the backdrop of Nazi oppression; no African American narratives or experiences exist within this story. The book explores various themes including fear and humanity but does not specifically focus on minorities like Starr Hoang from 'The Hate U Want.' It's important to distinguish between different authors, such as Zusak’s novels versus Doerr’s work which doesn't include a character named Liesel or African American perspectives within the context provided.
