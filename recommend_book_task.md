** Based on your interest in historical fiction with a focus on military aspects during World War II and social settings within European history for comparison, consider reading "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr as it beautifully narrates parallel stories of blind French girlagerin Elisabeth S-H.and German boy wartime scout Werner Pfadmann in WWII Paris where their paths eventually cross during one night and then disappearing into darkness, never to meet again or even know the others' existence but fate does have a way on its own that will lead them back together years later when tragedy has struck. This book not only offers an intense historical perspective from WWII era Paris with detailed descriptions of life during war times in France and Germany, their struggles against extreme adversities including poverty brought about by the circumstances but also sheds light on human connection amidst devastation while keeping a balance between hopefulness despite harsh realities.

Alternatively, if your interest lies more towards societal issues of today's world reflected in literature and you are open to non-fiction works as well, "The New Jim Crow" by Michelle Alexander is highly recommended for its exploration on how mass incarceration operates within the framework of systemic racism. It provides a critical examination into racial profiling that affects African American communities especially through disproportionate sentencing laws and policies, which impacted generations living with lifelong repercussions from being labeled as felons even after completing their sentences due to societal prejudice. It is an eye-opening read on understanding the deep racial divisions that persist in America's criminal justice system today despite progressive intent and efforts towards reform, thereby encouraging readers not only empathize with those affected by such discrimination but also educate themselves further about policies at play to promote societal change.

Lastly, for clients who are looking into personal identity exploration amidst a backdrop of contemporary issues like environmental concern or gender equality, we recommend reading "The Hidden Life" by Erika Schutz as it is set in present-day New York City where the main character Ella starts to notice strange occurrences around her.

As they navigate through this unusual situation and discover new things about themselves along with finding a sense of purpose in fighting against such global concerns, "The Hidden Life" not only offers an engaging narrative but also instills awareness on the importance to stand up for environmental justice while inspiring readers towards positive actions that contribute towards sustainability.
